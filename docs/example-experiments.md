# Example Experiments

- [Plankifier](https://github.com/pegasus-isi/kiso-plankifier-experiment):
  Plankton are effective indicators of environmental change and ecosystem health in freshwater habitats, but collection of plankton data using manual microscopic methods is extremely labor-intensive and expensive. Automated plankton imaging offers a promising way forward to monitor plankton communities with high frequency and accuracy in real-time. Yet, manual annotation of millions of images proposes a serious challenge to taxonomists. Deep learning classifiers have been successfully applied here to categorize marine plankton images.

- [Orcasound](https://github.com/pegasus-isi/kiso-orcasound-experiment):
  This workflow is based on an open-source software and hardware project that trains itself using the audio files generated via the hydrophone sensors deployed in three locations in the state of Washington (San Juan Island, Point Bush, and Port Townsend) in order to study Orca whales in the Pacific Northwest region. This workflow uses code and ideas available in the Orcasound GitHub actions workflow and the Orca Hello real-time notification system.
